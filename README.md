## üî¨ Quiz Structure

The core of this project is a comprehensive 30-question quiz structured to provide a holistic overview.

1.  **Level 1 (Foundational Questions)**: All users begin with 10 questions covering general feelings and stress levels.
2.  **Level 2 (Specific Scenarios)**: The quiz continues with the next 10 questions, delving into more specific life situations and emotional responses.
3.  **Level 3 (Detailed Assessment)**: The final 10 questions explore topics in greater detail to build a complete picture.
4.  **Final Recommendations**: After all 30 questions are answered, a total score is calculated. The application then provides a final recommendation based on this score, which may include wellness tips or suggest consulting a healthcare professional.

# MindMatters üß† - An Adaptive Mental Health Quiz

MindMatters is a thoughtful web application designed to guide users through a self-assessment quiz for mental well-being. Built as one of my first full-stack projects using Flask, it features an adaptive questionnaire that tailors its length and depth based on user responses, providing gentle recommendations at the end.

## üî¨ The Adaptive Quiz Logic

The core of this project is the logic that determines the user's path through the quiz.

1.  **Level 1 (Initial Screening)**: All users start with 10 foundational questions.
2.  **Evaluation Point**: After Level 1, a score is calculated. If the score is below a certain threshold, the quiz concludes with positive wellness recommendations (e.g., "Do yoga, exercise").
3.  **Level 2 (Deeper Dive)**: If the threshold is met, the user is presented with the next set of 10 more specific questions.
4.  **Final Evaluation**: A similar threshold logic is applied. This determines whether the user moves to the final level or receives moderate recommendations.
5.  **Level 3 (Detailed Assessment)**: For users whose answers indicate a higher level of concern, the final 10 questions are presented.
6.  **Final Recommendations**: The application provides its final recommendation based on the total score, which may include strongly suggesting the user consult with a healthcare professional.
